Full version of my project completed for Coursera Specialized Models: Time Series and Survival Analysis course. The main objective of this project was to explore different time series modeling approaches, including ARIMA-based models, Facebook Prophet and LSTM Deep Learning approach, based on Household Energy Consumption data set, obtained from UCI Machine Learning repository.
